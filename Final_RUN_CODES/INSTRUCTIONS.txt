1. These files consists of parallel MPI and serial code using Manhattan
2. I have used only 7000 genes and 10 samples for comparison
3. The main point here is I have eliminated sampling in the serial and parallel code.
4. The time and clockcycle comparison shows how good the MPI code is.
5. Run it with 4 MPI ranks.
6. You need to copy the input.bin file to aimos


mpicc -g MPI_Code_Manhattan_clustering.c -lm -o k_conly_mpi22.exe


gcc -g  Serial_Code_with_Manhattan.c -o mycode4 -lm



Reason for using only 7000 genes and 10 samples:
1. Since we are not doing the sampling approach, the serial code will take hours to run as the genes increase, To avoid this, for the sake of comparison we use slightly 
smaller dataset.
