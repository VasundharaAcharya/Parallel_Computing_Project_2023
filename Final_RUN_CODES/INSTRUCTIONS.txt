1. These files consists of parallel MPI and serial code using Manhattan
2. I have used only 7000 genes and 10 samples for comparison
3. The main point here is I have eliminated sampling in the serial and parallel code.
4. The time and clockcycle comparison shows how good the MPI code is.
5. Run it with 4 MPI ranks
