Gene expression dataset (Golub et al.)
Description
This dataset comes from a proof-of-concept study published in 1999 by Golub et al. It showed how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. 
These data were used to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
There are 34 samples in the dataset. The dataset contains gene expression data for 7129 genes across 34 different biological samples.
These datasets contain measurements corresponding to ALL and AML samples from Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood.
