Title :A rice gene expression matrix derived from large-scaled RNA-seq datasets

This dataset contains a gene expression matrix used to construct rice gene co-expression networks. 
The matrix has expression values  (log2(cpm+1)) for 33,846 genes derived from 8,456 publicaly available  high-quality rice RNA-seq runs, 
which were downloaded from the NCBI SRA  database as of June 2021.
